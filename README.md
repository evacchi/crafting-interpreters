Crafting Interpreters 

## [clox](clox)

Simple, word-by-word implementation of the Lox interpreter in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).


Commits try to follow 100% the Chapters of the book (bugs permitting)

## [rlox](rlox)

My attempt to translate `clox` while I learn Rust. 

Work In Progress, may be not 100% idiomatic while I try to follow the book; will probably revisit and clean up when I hit the bottom.
